It's already March!

Since my last post I updated this site to add a logo image and add a link to 
another project from the Udemy course.

I admit the logo image is not a logo. I just wanted to show off the cool photo.
Look at me. I'm so little. But taking in the view made me feel huge and that I 
was a part of the vastness before me.

It's been a busy February and now I need to get back on track and do the things
I want to do.
