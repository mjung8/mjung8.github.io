Thursday

I slacked a bit because I need to finish The Leftovers and get on with my life.

I started coding along with the videos. On Monday I created a git repo for the
project and added the first commit using the files provided. 
Tuesday I did nothinig. Yesterday I watched episode 1 again to verify I knew 
what was going on.

Today I coded along to episodes 2 and 3.

Let me see if I can make sense of the stuff from episode 3.

WorldController Start creates an empty World.  
Then it creates a bunch of game objects for every tile and registers the tile's callback as the anonymous function.  
Then the tiles are randomized. Randomizing the tiles will set the tile type.  
When a tile type is set it runs the callback function (the anonymous function) 
which then runs the function to change the tile.
