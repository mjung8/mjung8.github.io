So far I've done some simple tutorials from [raywenderlich.com](https://raywenderlich.com)
and that felt like an accomplishment. I'm also watching a base-building game playlist of 
tutorials. I'm delighted at how things have come together between school, coop, and my
mentorship and I'm finally doing what I want to do!

Notes

Sprites  
-sprite mode single, multiple, polygon  
-sprite editor slicing auto, grid by cell size  
-assigning sprites to GameObjects  
-pixels per unit which I don't really understand  
-max size of sprite assets

-Sorting Layers, Order in Layer

Animation  
-create animation clip (then add property sprite, drag and drop sprites, space apart)  
-animation controller (create states, create transitions, parameters/condition, transition properties)
