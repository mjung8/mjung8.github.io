Wednesday

I coded up to and including episode 7. My approach is to watch the video first without coding along and then watching again while coding along. I play the videos on 1.3-1.7x speed so it's not bad.

I did not achieve my goal of watching at least one video a day but I think I was close and I feel good about what I learned.

Features so far:  
--Generate's a World with a 100 x 100 tilemap with randomly placed floor tiles  
--Camera movement and zoom  
--Click and drag to change tile types  
--UI buttons to change tile type (e.g. build floor or bulldoze)

One thing in particular I enjoyed was learning how to modify the editor to aid in development. For the Build Menu, there is a script that will resize its container based on the number of buttons. This resize can occur manually with a button click in the editor and it occurs automatically at runtime.
