I'm not useless anymore and have acquired a coop job for 8 months. So far it's 
really great.

Since my last post in March, I continued to apply to jobs and kept up with school.
The last semester went well and my GPA increased.

At work I have a huge opportunity to learn things that align with my personal
goal of making a game. In addition to the job, I entered a mentorship and I'm
also enjoying that a lot.

I added a [Unity](../../../../unity/) section to keep track of my productivity. The plan right now
is to complete one tutorial per day and make notes in order to keep track of
the concepts I'm trying to learn.
